# Tree Project

This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive tree structure with drag-and-drop functionality and a context menu for node management. It uses webpack for bundling and other modern web development practices.

## Features
- Display a tree structure.
- Edit, add, and remove nodes using a context menu.
- Drag and drop nodes to reorganize the tree.
- Modular JavaScript structure with separated concerns.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: For the logic and interaction of the tree structure.
- **Webpack**: For bundling the JavaScript, CSS, and assets.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the tree.
- **ES6 Modules**: For modular JavaScript code.
- **Drag-and-Drop API**: For node reordering.
- **Context Menu**: For editing, adding, and removing nodes.
